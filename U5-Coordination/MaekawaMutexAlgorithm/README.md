# A project skeleton

A set of nodes can exchange messages among them in multicast and also send one-to-one messages using socket library.

A node has two-child threads to manage the communication: a ServerNode (get requests) and NodeSend (send requests).

This project is the based skeleton to design and implement the Maekawa Mutex algorithm with Lamport timestamps.

Execute the basic structure:
```bash
uv run main.py
```

Run grep in the project folder to find all tags that are necessary to modify. Note: **feel free** to modify another parts of the code (include more functions, classes, etc.)
```bash
grep "#TODO" *
```
