# A project skeleton

A set of nodes can exchange messages among them in multicast and also send one-to-one messages using socket library.

A node has two-child threads to manage the communication: a ServerNode (get requests) and NodeSend (send requests).

This project is the based skeleton to design and implement the Maekawa Mutex algorithm with Lamport timestamps.
